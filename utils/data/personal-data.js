  description: "Hi, I’m Dishu — a software developer with a passion for building smart, useful, and user-friendly technology. I love turning complex ideas into intuitive digital experiences, whether it’s through clean code, automation, or creating products like Dockie, my AI-powered file explorer.\nMy background spans full-stack development, AI integration, and solving real-world problems with practical tools. I’ve worked as a freelancer, an intern at Geotab, and contributed to several personal projects that reflect my curiosity and love for experimentation. When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring tech trends, sharing insights on LinkedIn, or learning something completely new to push my limits. I value clean design, smart functionality, and products that just work. I’m currently open to freelance opportunities, collaborations, or full-time roles where I can grow and make an impact. Let’s build something amazing together.",
